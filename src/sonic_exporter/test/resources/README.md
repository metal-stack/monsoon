# test/resources

This folder is meant to mock a sonic device locally with all its state data.
This helps developers to develop for switches without the need of real hardware.
And testing inter operability between different software releases for sonic.

This validation and mock directory needs to be redone when we will rely on sonic-swss-common instead of sonic-py-swsssdk.
